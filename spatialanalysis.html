            <p>We have experience working with government, industry, and other stakeholders to develop risk assessment frameworks. Through the development of such frameworks, we have been able to help mitigate major threats, such as pipe breaks, by using GIS tools to assess vulnerable areas and other risk factors, such as the resilience of a system and the potential consequences if a threat event were to occur. </p>

            <p>Selecting areas that are appropriate for a specific function is something that we have a lot of experience in. Our past projects include habitat selection for snails using a selection of tools (e.g., overlay analysis, buffer creation, and creatin geoprocessing work flows in model builder). The results of our analyses are far reaching and relevant for implementation at the policy level for </p>
